There are lots of online viewers and editors (as well as editors for you computer) that make viewing and changing JSON files easier.\n\nPython can read and write to any of these file formats easily. In addition, there are a couple of libraries, csv and json, that make it even easier:\n\n    import csv\n    import json\n\nTo write to a json file for example,\n\n    import jason\n    # define person record in dictionary\n    person = {}\n    person["firstName"] = "Stuart"\n    person["surname"] = "Moore"\n    person["gender"] = "Male"\n    # write record to file in json format\n    with open(\'example.json\', \'w\') as f: \n        json.dump(person, f)\n\nwhich would write the following to the file:\n{"firstName": "Stuart", "surname": "Moore", "gender": "Male"}\n\nYour other option is to use a database. The most common database application in the world in sqlite. It is used by all of the major operating systems for desktop, server and mobile (smartphone/table) computers and by very many applications. A sqlite database is also just a file, but not human readable (there are, of course, desktop and mobile tools to let you manage them and change them).

Probably not a big difference? Maybe performance/speed, but I have no perspective on that.\n\nEither way, it sounds like you\'re getting some data (decibels, angles), and you want to do some calculations. You could do that without even writing the data to a *.json/csv, but it could be useful to do so because maybe later down the line you want to remember exactly where those 2 numbers (your calculations) came from. \n\nAnd if you have the data stored in a *.json file that your code that performs the calculations (conversion, averaging, ratio etc) can read, you can then remember/do the calculations again if you want.\n\nIn any case, it all depends on your exact needs! I would say you could try any data format you want, and hopefully you\'ll find one that works nicely for your use cases. Also I don\'t claim to be an expert, I just know what I know from personal experiences, and maybe you\'ll have a different one than me! ', '7sw8t5');
